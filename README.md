# Cocktail Index
This is a Phoenix web application for managing a library of cocktail recipes
and one or more liquor (et al) collections.

I built this application to learn Elixir and Phoenix to scratch a particular
itch. I will not guarantee anyone else will find it useful.

## Production deployment
